# cxxeffect

I'm gonna be honest. I have no clue what I'm doing, I don't write C++, and so
far this is just a carbon-copy port of fs2/cats-effect to C++. I'm hoping that
this project will improve as I write more C++ but that may take a long long
time.

If you're proficient in C++ and like the prospect of purity/functional streams
in C++ please help
